Yet another client for Dribbble. I know the name sounds ridiculous (it is subject to change btw) and it looks like a ripoff of the awesome plaid by nickbutcher, but believe me I've tried to make it as distinct as possible :(

The current state of the app can be considered "usable", and features are being added on a daily basis. I consider this a learning opportunity so suggestions are more than welcome!
